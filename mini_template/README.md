# mini_template
mini_template is a template engine written in Rust and is inspired by [smarty](https://smarty.net) and [twig](https://twig.symfony.com/). You can use this crate in production, but it is still missing some basic features.
## Motivation
In 2021 I started development on [i3_notify_bar](https://github.com/Julian-Alberts/i3_notify_bar), a program that allows for customizable notifications in i3-wm. Back then, I needed a template engine that allowed me to modify variables inside the template with a user-friendly syntax. After experimenting with different crates, I decided to develop my own.
