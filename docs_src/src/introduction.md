This documentation is currently WIP. Most sections are not written yet or need 
better descriptions and/or examples. For the time being take a look at the 
[README](https://github.com/Julian-Alberts/mini_template_rs/blob/main/README.md).
# Introduction


mini_template is a template engine written in Rust and is inspired by [smarty](https://smarty.net) and [twig](https://twig.symfony.com/). You can use this crate in production, but it is still missing some basic features.
