# Basics
Every mini_template instruction is contained inside a pair of opening 
and closing brackets. 


## Returning a value
To return a value place the identifier between two delimiters. 
```smarty
{ var }
```

If you want to modify a value before it is printed you can add modifiers.
```smarty
{ var|modifier }
```
You can find more information about modifiers [here](modifier.md).
